# M5 Cardputer Math Game

A maths game written for the new [M5 Cardputer](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/Cardputer
).

This version asks you multiplication questions suitable for a middle schooler in groups of 10 then tells you the score!

I like this approach because I can give it to my offsprint, the games are focussed on her needs, also there is no internet or other similar distractions.
